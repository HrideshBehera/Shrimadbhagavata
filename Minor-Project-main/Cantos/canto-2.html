                N캐rada Muni explained that the essence of the science of God, encapsulated in 콐r캶mad-Bh캐gavatam, was imparted to him by the Lord Himself. This profound knowledge, known as S캐攷khya-yoga, was disseminated to various great personalities, including Prahl캐da and Brahm캐, illustrating the lineage of its transmission.

However, upon realizing their true spiritual nature beyond material time and energy, they transcend the misconceptions of "I" and "mine."
                <br>
                Lord Brahm캐, through devoted penance in bhakti-yoga, pleased the Lord who then revealed His eternal form, the ultimate purifying goal for conditioned souls. Brahm캐, unable to trace the source of his lotus seat, heard divine syllables guiding him towards creation. He undertook severe penances for a thousand celestial years, controlling his mind and senses, exemplifying asceticism for all beings.

                <br>
                Brahm캐, overwhelmed with joy upon seeing the Lord, was empowered to create. The Lord then instructed Brahm캐 on the confidential knowledge of creation, emphasizing devotional service. Brahm캐, after re-creating the universe, instructed N캐rada, who in turn taught Vy캐sadeva, culminating in the narration of 콐r캶mad-Bh캐gavatam.

                <br>
                The text describes the creation of the universe and the subsequent interactions governed by material modes. It elucidates the right conduct for living beings, the science of God including His incarnations, and the process of liberation.

                Additionally, it details the manifestation of various bodily functions and senses, guided by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

                The text emphasizes the transcendental nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, beyond the material conceptions depicted earlier. It clarifies that the Lord's direct interference in creation is to counteract the misconception of material nature as the creator.
